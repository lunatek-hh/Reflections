What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The way to initialise a repository is by using the command : "git init".
THe way to check on what files and how many commits we hace is by using the command: "git status"
When we initialise the repository a new empty hidden git folder is created.
There are 0 commits made at that moment, it merely says that we are now working as a version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a temporary area where the files to be commited are compiled together.
It is different from the working directory in the sense that not all files of the directory needs to be there, thus only those files where actual changes are happening can be committed to this.
It has the value of not needing to repeat files, thus saving space. on the other hand, it does seem a little tedious and time consuming to individually keep adding files.
this might prove to be sligthly counter-productive if there are too many files which need commitment
