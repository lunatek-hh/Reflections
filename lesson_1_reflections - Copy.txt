How did viewing a FC between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This is rather interesting, because uptill now comparisions between my work was basically being done manually.
But FC has really helped in making the process a little simpler.
Though it is something which i need to get used to the presentation is not exactly regular english. 
I am sure some comparision GUI based software would probably to a better and even faster job.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient programmer in the long term?
There are multiple advantages, in my opinion, that helps when saving multiple versions of a file.
For instance, it will be a good checkpoint system for different states of the project.
Any mistake made in the newere versions can lead to easy rectification by accessing an older version, where the project was moving in the correct state.
As a programmer vesion control comparisions can help in easily highlighting mistakes, made by me, thus allowing me to be more alert to the kind of mistakes i tend to make.
