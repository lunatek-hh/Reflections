When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is great for collaborating with other users on the same project.
it is also a great way of keeping your files on a cloud server to be used by the same user in multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not sure
